In this project, an accuracy comparison of four classification model is done. These four classification models are, 
KNN classifier, support vector machines, decision-tree classifier and logistic regression classifier. 

Two seprate data-sets are used for this project, load_train.csv is used to train the model and load_test.csv is 
used for accuracy measurements.
