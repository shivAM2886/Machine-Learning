In this project average rating of board games is predicted using other independent variables. The regression for the average rating is done 
using Randomforest, KNN & linear regression models. Their performance is compared with each other.

The data-set is scraped by Sean Beck, github username "ThaWeatherman", (https://github.com/ThaWeatherman). The data-set is also uploaded on
Kaggle. I used Kaggle notebook for this project, link for which is copied below.
