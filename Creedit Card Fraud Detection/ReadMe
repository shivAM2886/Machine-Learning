In this project, an analysis is done to detect fraudlent credit card transaction. The project was originally done on Kaggle using the
credit card data-set uploaded by Machine Learning Group (ULB) {http://mlg.ulb.ac.be/}.

Naive bayes based classifier model is used to achieve this task. The data-set is highly imbalanced with fraudlent transaction accounting
for very small percentage of the data. Synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) is used to oversample the minority data, initially
an exploratory data analysis is done.
